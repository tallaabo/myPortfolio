        I am Abdirahman Hassan (Aman). I was raised in a small village in northern Somalia and moved to the US five years ago. 
        Growing up, I was always eager to learn about and use new technologies.  My interest in technology and engineering 
        got more intense during my senior year of high school when I had an internship at 3M. It was there that I realized 
        the integral role of software developers in making machines function. This realization ignited my passion again for 
        computer science, particularly in software development. I have since acquired a solid foundation of knowledge and 
        skills in this field whether at the University of Minnesota or on my own.
