Being a student is not easy, <br />
The roadâ€™s not lined with flowers, nor cheesy. <br />
With knowledge, I strive to be busy, <br />
Though at times, my mind feels dizzy. <br />
People can be teasy, their words may sting, <br />
But I push forward, doing my own thing. <br />
Long nights of study, eyes growing bleary, <br />
Yet dreams of success keep me cheery. <br />
The path may be steep, the climb uneasy, <br />
But I'll press on, never growing lazy. <br />
For learning is a journey, not always breezy, <br />
But in the end, it will be worth the feezy.
