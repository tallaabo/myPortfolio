Being a student is not easy,
The roadâ€™s not lined with flowers, nor cheesy.
With knowledge, I strive to be busy,
Though at times, my mind feels dizzy.
People can be teasy, their words may sting,
But I push forward, doing my own thing.
Long nights of study, eyes growing bleary,
Yet dreams of success keep me cheery.
The path may be steep, the climb uneasy,
But I'll press on, never growing lazy.
For learning is a journey, not always breezy,
But in the end, it will be worth the feezy.
