Freeman received a phone message with an address, and while leaving home, his brother asked where he was going. <br />
He said, "I have an appointment." <br />
His brother replied, unsure: "On Sunday?!" <br />
He said nothing and gently slammed the door behind him. He took the elevator down and started his tiny, old vehicle. <br /> <br />
Freeman drove 30 minutes with a heavy heart and ended up in a jungle. It was a cold, scary, quiet, and empty place. He sat on a chair lying in the middle of tall, dead trees. <br />
Freeman gave a paper with a list of previous duties to a person he could only see. Freeman was feeling a mix of sadness, sorrow, and anger. <br /> <br />
He received a new list of tasks he must fulfill in the next week. He checked the new list, bit his jaw, looked up, took a deep breath, then put his right hand on his cheek, lowering his head down. <br />
While Freeman was walking back to his car, he was screaming, “Why me?” and kicking trees and the ground. Then, he suddenly heard a voice calling his name. He traced where the voice was coming from, and after a while, found a beautiful place that was just behind the woods. <br /> <br />
The place had green trees, waterfalls, breezy air, and calming sunshine. Then he saw a man whom again he could only see, and asked who he was?! <br />
The stranger said: I know you’re not happy with what they ordered you to do. <br />
Freeman interrupted and said: They, what do you mean they? And how do you know me?! <br />
The stranger kept talking and concluded, “Stop asking stupid questions; everybody knows you, and don’t just feel, do something”. <br />
Freeman: What do you mean?! <br />
Stranger: Do you like this place? <br />
Freeman: Yes. <br />
Stranger: You can choose to stay here, it’s up to you! <br />
Freeman: But what about them?! <br />
Stranger: If you destroy the bridge that’s connecting you with them, you might be free, or maybe go a little further and go after them. <br /> <br />
Freeman was shocked, scared, and enlightened but liked the idea. <br />
After a little brainstorming, he decided he couldn’t live with this anymore. <br />
Freeman asked the stranger for help and ammunition. <br />
The stranger said, “You can only see; therefore, you can only solve. It’s your own war, man.” <br />
Freeman took a plank of wood and walked towards the "grey" area. There was no one; therefore, he burned the bridge and his phone, so they would never reach out to him. <br />
Freeman went back to the green, beautiful place, calling it his new home and uttering I am Free-Man! <br />I am Free-Man! <br />I am Free-Man!
