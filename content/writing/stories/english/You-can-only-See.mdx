Freeman received a phone message with an address, and while leaving home, his brother asked where he was going. He said, "I have an appointment." His brother replied, unsure: "On Sunday?!" He said nothing and gently slammed the door behind him. He took the elevator down and started his tiny, old vehicle. 
Freeman drove 30 minutes with a heavy heart and ended up in a jungle. It was a cold, scary, quiet, and empty place. He sat on a chair lying in the middle of tall, dead trees. Freeman gave a paper with a list of previous duties to a person he could only see. Freeman was feeling a mix of sadness, sorrow, and anger. He received a new list of tasks he must fulfill in the next week. He checked the new list, bit his jaw, looked up, took a deep breath, then put his right hand on his cheek, lowering his head down. 
While Freeman was walking back to his car, he was screaming, “Why me?” and kicking trees and the ground. Then, he suddenly heard a voice calling his name. He traced where the voice was coming from, and after a while, found a beautiful place that was just behind the woods. The place had green trees, waterfalls, breezy air, and calming sunshine. Then he saw a man whom again he could only see, and asked who he was?! The stranger said: I know you’re not happy with what they ordered you to do. Freeman interrupted and said: They, what do you mean they? And how do you know me?! The stranger kept talking and concluded, “Stop asking stupid questions; everybody knows you, and don’t just feel, do something”. 
Freeman: What do you mean?! 
Stranger: Do you like this place? 
Freeman: Yes. 
Stranger: You can choose to stay here, it’s up to you! 
Freeman: But what about them?! 
Stranger: If you destroy the bridge that’s connecting you with them, you might be free, or maybe go a little further and go after them. 
Freeman was shocked but liked the idea. After a little brainstorming, he decided he couldn’t live with this anymore. Freeman asked the stranger for help and ammunition. The stranger said, “You can only see; therefore, you can only solve. It’s your own war.” Freeman took a plank of wood and walked towards the grey area. There was no one; therefore, he burned the bridge and his phone, so they would never reach out to him. Freeman went back to the green, beautiful place, calling it his new home and uttering I am Free-Man! I am Free-Man! I am Free-Man!
