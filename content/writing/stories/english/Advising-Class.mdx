By the time I arrived in the US, my older brother, who lived in the US for a while, told me to start school as soon as possible. He said, “It is the only way you can understand and adapt to the country.” I never thought the adaptation was going to be hard and mysterious.
	I started high school, which was next to a church that had once been the tallest building in the city. It had been six months, and I had never attended that one class on my schedule. One day, the principal approached me and said, “Hey, Abiraham, is everything OK? 
I replied, “Well, that’s not my name, but what’s up?”
Her: I noticed that you’ve never attended this class!" 
I asked, "Which one?" 
She said, "The advising class!" 
I asked, "The what?" 
She explained, "The advising class! They provide academic guidance." 
I opened my eyes wide and said, “Guidance, I don’t want to convert; I’m already guided.” She giggled, bursting into uninhibited laughter. She said, “You’re funny, and now go to your class." She tricked me; it was never just a one-class but a lifetime class. I am still taking it now!
