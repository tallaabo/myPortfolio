## Overview

**Optimization-Project** is a C benchmarking framework built to measure and compare different approaches to matrix traversal and aggregation.
It evaluates **control (baseline)** implementations against **student (optimized)** ones for tasks like collecting every 5th element and summing all values.
The project highlights cache-friendly programming patterns, loop optimizations, and timing analysis.

## Features

- üéØ Control vs. optimized implementations for fairness testing  
- üß™ Deterministic matrix initialization with fixed random seed  
- ‚è±Ô∏è CPU & wall-clock timing via `clock_gettime`  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Even- and odd-sized matrix dimensions to test alignment effects  
- üìä Speed ratio reporting to quantify performance gains  
- üßπ Memory cleanup with `free_matrix` to avoid leaks  
<br></br>

## Tech Stack

- **C (C11)** for implementation  
- **POSIX clock API** (`CLOCK_REALTIME`, `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`)  
- Custom **matrix module** (`matrix.h/.c`) for setup and teardown  
- **GCC** (recommended) with `-O3` and architecture flags for benchmarking
