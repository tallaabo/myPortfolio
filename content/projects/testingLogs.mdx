## Overview
**SampleTrack** is a Python-based application designed to make laboratory and testing workflows more reliable.  
It integrates badge scans and cover sheet scans into a central database, ensuring every sample movement—pickup, drop-off, or test—is logged in real time.  
The goal is to provide a clear audit trail that simplifies debugging, compliance, and reporting.
